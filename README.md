# 1325_finalProj
group project for CSE 1325 object-oriented programming class

# How to Run
1. Compile all .java files in the finalProj package.
2. Run the MovieCollectionFE class:
~~~
java finalProj.MovieCollectionFE
~~~
4. Follow the console prompts to add, search, remove, rate, and list movies.

# Example Usage
- Add a Movie: Enter movie details like title, director, release year, and genre.
- Search: Use title, director, or genre to find a movie.
- Rate: Rate a specific movie from 1 to 5.
- List All Movies: See a list of all movies in the collection.

# Notes
- Ratings are on a 1-5 scale; movies without a rating display as 0.
- The program supports a maximum collection size based on the initial input during setup.
- Ensure input values (such as year) are realistic to avoid default values.
- This program provides a basic but functional way to manage a movie collection in Java.
